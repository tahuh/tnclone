# How to test data

Create an output directory such as output

Then create subdirectory called "trimmed"

Below trimmed create two directories "A8REH9" and "A5EIM8" and locate fastq files into those directories

Namely, locate "A8REH9_1_R1.trimmed.fastq" and "A8REH9_1_R2.trimmed.fastq" into "A8REH9" directory, and perform other files likely in this manner.

Create a directory to store reference sequence called "ref"

Put all reference sequence related files (.fa , .fa.dict, .fa.xxx) in this directory

Then execute with reference mapping engine workflow as decribed in manual.
